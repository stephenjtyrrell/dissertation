# Example Terraform variables file
# NOTE: With the cloud-specific directory structure, each cloud directory
# should have its own terraform.tfvars file with only relevant variables.
#
# For AWS deployment: copy this to infra/terraform/aws/terraform.tfvars
# For Azure deployment: copy this to infra/terraform/azure/terraform.tfvars
# For GCP deployment: copy this to infra/terraform/gcp/terraform.tfvars
#
# Then customize the variables for your specific cloud provider.

# Project configuration
project_name = "dissertation-pipeline"
environment  = "dev"

# Network configuration
cidr_block        = "10.42.0.0/16"
subnet_cidr_block = "10.42.1.0/24"

# Cloud-specific configurations (use only the ones relevant to your target cloud)
# For AWS:
aws_region   = "us-east-1"

# For Azure:
azure_location = "eastus"

# For GCP:
gcp_region     = "us-central1"
gcp_project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"

# Mandatory governance tags/labels
mandatory_tags = {
  owner       = "platform-team"
  cost_center = "cc-001"
  compliance  = "baseline"
  project     = "dissertation-pipeline"
  environment = "dev"
  managed_by  = "terraform"
}
